# pandoc-to-canvas

I find it convenient to store my course `.tex` files in GitHub, and
then upload `.pdf` and `.html` (generated by pandoc) to the Canvas
course.

The script `upload.rb` handles the uploading.  It's an old ruby script
using `pandarus` which is surely overkill here.  I'd love to replace
this with something a bit slicker.
